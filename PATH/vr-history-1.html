          <h3 class="card-title">Stereoscopic view</h3>
          <p class="card-text">In 1838, Charles Wheatstone created the idea of stereoscopic depth and immersion. He did this by using two stereoscopic images which if looked at created a 3 dimensional image. Around a decade later, a scientist named David Brewster improved the claim by saying that if you put a card into stereo images, it looks as if a scene came alive. The stereoscope blew up in popularity and began to be used everywhere in the mid 19th century. Many different models were created such as ones cheaper than the original and ones that said they could take you anywhere in the world. It even was used for educational purposes such as by astronomers to determine information about the moon and for educational purposes. While the stereoscope craze eventually died out, it lead the way for the research of a new scientific topic known as Virtual Reality. Now, Virtual Reality may be the future of how communication and educational learning take place.

          <p class="card-text">In 1929, Edward Link created the Link Trainer. The device was electromechanical which means it electrically operated. The device was controlled by motors which were linked to the rudder and steering column which would change the pitch and roll. There was a small motor which emulated turbulence and disturbances in the air to create the illusion of flying a plane. They were used in the military to train soldiers as a training aid for when if they were to actually fly a plane or jet. It helped soldiers get experience with the feeling of riding a jet such as the Grumman Avenger TBF/TBM torpedo bomber. Ground school at NAS Fort Lauderdale used Trainer Flight Simulators during the course of World War II to help soldiers learn how to navigate Avenger aircraft.

            <h3 class="card-title">The Sensorama</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In the mid 1950s, Morton Heilig created the Sensorama which took advantage of all 5 senses instead of two. It used stereo speakers, a 3D stereoscopic display, fans, smell detector and a vibrating chair which was unlike anything ever seen with all 5 in use. It worked with 6 films titled Motorcycle, Belly Dancer, Dune Buggy, Helicopter, A date with Sabina and I’m a Coca Cola Bottle. The 3D film could be viewed through a set of “ocular portals” and filled an impressive part of the user's vision. In Motorcycle, the seat would thrust forward and backward to offer the illusion of actually riding a motorcycle. It also included a “fan-generated breeze” and a number of scents which would emerge from the vents to make it feel more realistic. In 1962, Morton Heilig created the Sensorama which had the capability of playing a 3D video. It uses stereo sound and creates aromas and winds to fully immerse someone and believe they are actually there in a specific scene. Throughout his life, Morton Heilig was interested in arts and when he grew up, he was very intrigued by the idea of using the five senses in short films. In the industry, there was a massive boom in 3D and stereoscopic technology which made him decide to make a device that triggered 4 of the 5 senses including sight, hearing, smell and touch. The Sensorama was a “side-by-side dual film 35mm camera and was small enough to be used as a hand-held device”. The Sensorama included a bucket seat for one person and a set of viewing holes and handles that were surrounded by vents which were covered to avoid distractions. Eventually, Heilig used this design for his IMAX movie design which was used by many studios including Disney. At the end of the day, Heilig’s creation helped inspire many future minds on the topic of Virtual Reality.

            <p class="card-text">By 1960, Morton Heilig created the Telesphere Mask which was the first sign of a head-mounted display but didn't use any motion tracking technology. It also was known for using “stereoscopic 3D and wide vision with stereo sound”.

            <p class="card-text">In 1961, two philco workers known as Comeau & Bryan created the first motion tracking HMD which ironically wasn’t made for virtual reality purposes. It used a video screen for each eye and a magnetic motion tracking device which liked to a closed circuit camera. Head movements were tracked by a remote camera which allowed the user to look around at their environments. With all its benefits, it still couldn’t integrate computer and image technology.
