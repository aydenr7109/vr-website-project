        <h3 class="card-title">The Ultimate Display</h3>
        <p class="card-text">In 1965, Ivan Sutherland described “The Ultimate Display”
        It allowed a user to experience a world that looked real and was possible to interact with through an HMD.

        <h3 class="card-title">Sword of Damocles</h3>
        <p class="card-text">In 1968, Ivan Sutherland and a student of his, Bob Sprull, created the first Vr/Ar HMD which was connected to a computer rather than a camera.
          It was far too heavy making it super uncomfortable to use and the displayed graphics were very primitive.

        <h3 class="card-title">Video Games and Virtual Reality</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Eventually, many advancements in Virtual Reality were seen in connection with video games
        In 1991, the Virtuality Group created an assortment of games that used immersive stereoscopic 3D visuals to display a game and even offered multiplayer.
        In 1993, SEGA announced a VR headset that prototype glasses that wrapped around a person’s head which created head tracking, stereo sound and LCD screens in the visor but was never released.
        In 1995, Nintendo announced the Virtual Boy which claimed to be the first 3D console but was a commercial failure due to a lack of colors and bad way to experience the games made for it
        Lastly, when The Matrix was released in 1999, it helped revolutionize the depiction of Virtual Reality.
        Nowadays, there are many signs of Virtual Reality with advanced technology such as Playstation Vr, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, and Nintendo labo Vr Set.
        Lastly, HTC and Valve announce their VR headset called Vive.
        Nowadays, we have the Oculus Rift
      The Oculus Rift is a VR headset which was backed on Kickstarter and uses motion sensors to help simulate a virtual environment.
      The Oculus Rift uses a pair of screens that display two images side by side and a set of lenses which are placed on top of the panels which focus and reshape a picture for each eye and in turn create a 3D image.
      They are equipped with sensors that monitor head motions and adjust an image should a person’s head moves.
      The Rift specs include a “2160 x 1200 OLED display” which allows an image to be displayed at 1080p for both eyes as well as a “110-degree field of view with a 90Hz refresh rate”
      It also includes an accelerator, a gyroscope, a magnetometer and 360-degree positional tracking that can follow up to 6 axes of movement and direction and also include touch controllers.
      Overall, the Oculus Rift includes a number of interesting technological components to make it one of the best VR headsets of the current generation.
